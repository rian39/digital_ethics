- been doing slides -- have around 20 now;
- refocused on phronesis for machine learning; played out between truth and care
- is this the sketch of an article? Maybe -- how to include more experience?
- would need to engage with some of the literature -- crawford, seaver, ziewitz, etc. 
- for the 20 minute presentation, go it down to 20 slides. 
- turned the slide outline into an article outline
