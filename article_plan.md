## Overview
- Digital from all directions – which directions are most important?
- Ethics in the sense of a good way to live (not rules or morality, etc.): habits or dispositions
- Digital phronesis: what stable dispositions – virtues – do we need in order to live well together?
- A site of emergent phronesis: truth and care in machine learning

## Digital from all directions

- Affects the texture of experience (everyday life, knowledge, health, sexuality, work, etc.)
    - Re-weaves co-existence and hence sociality
    - Super-saturated connectability + intense distractability
- Two important contemporary features 
    - Heavy concentration of communicative resources (Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc.)
    - Despite claims to newness, many continuities with mass media
    - Many ethical questions around digital are tied to with transformations in media
- Predictive relationality
    -Machine learning, pattern recognition, data analytics
    -Increasingly pervasive technical practice of sorting, ranking, classifying, labelling, recognising, and predicting saturate social fabric with relationality

## Digital practice creates many ethical problems:

- Can't live without it, but how to live better with it?
- What shared norms or moral good pertain amidst concentration + predictive relationality?
- Can you calculate the consequences of relationalities engendered through digital practice?
- How to live better: what would be the digital 'good'?
- De-couple understanding of  digital practice from myths such as democracy, freedom, sharing, participation
    - See Morozov, The Net Delusion
    - Freedom of the market does not offer substantive alternative conception of freedom
- If neither democratic or market freedoms are sufficient, then are there any universals can we draw on?

## Digital phronesis: a set of habits attuned to the contradictions a 'better life.' 

 Phronesis in Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics
A technical skill, not purely intellectual:
Translated as 'intelligence', 'practical wisdom,' 'prudence'
Cf episteme (science?), techne (craft/production?)
“phronesis is not scientific knowledge because it apprehends the last step, since the thing is to be done is of this nature”  (215)

Close to practice, not focused on universals or abstractions
- Aristotle calls phronesis a  hexis – stable, well-developed habits, acquired through skilful practice
- Aristotle often uses language of 'calculation', 'deliberation'


## Phronesis – close to practice 
'phronesis is not concerned with universals only; it must take cognizance of particulars, because it is concerned with conduct, and conduct has its sphere in particular circumstances'
 
 Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics, Bk VI)

##  Could there be a digital phronesis?

 Alisdair MacIntyre's argument (1981) about phronesis today
 Need to update phronesis to take into account city-state pre-conditions in Aristotle 
 Bent Flyvbjerg's argument (2001) about social sciences as phronetic
 Phronesis provides important antidote to problems of scientism in knowledges of the social
 Puig de la Bellacasa's account (2012) of care and thinking through things
 Thinking and relational fabric are linked
 
##  Case study: phronesis in machine learning?
 In crafting, implementing, maintaining or repairing machine learning or classification algorithms, what dispositions matter?
 Maintain investments in truth-oriented practices and something like care


##  Practices of truth in machine learning?
 Machine learning developed and widely used in sciences (genomics, statistics, remote sensing), but now intensively active in media, commerce and government 
 New knowledges flows from new relationalities emerging from models (classifiers, deep learners);
 Similar techniques applied broadly to many different setttings: image recognition, voice recognition, targetted advertising, credit risk calculation, etc., etc.
 Increasingly standardised formatting of social fabric in terms of predictive actionability

##  Practices of truth
 Technical focus on error rates and accuracy vs  interpretability of the models;
 More interpretable models are not necessarily the most predictive or actionable
 Predictively-driven action may not be phronetically good

##  Example: NSA machine learns Al-Qaeda operatives using SkyNet – identifies Al-Jazeera journalist

##  Frame this disposition in terms of relationality:
 Care: “doing those doings needed to create, hold together and sustain life’s essential heterogeneity.” (Bellacasa, 2012, 198) 
 Sustain the environment on which individual and social fabric depend
 Take account of communication in a digital media fabric:
 do not make the world more dangerous?

##  Care in machine learning?
 “But if care is a doing, is there a practical feature of this form of caring?” 
  (Bellacasa, 2012, 202)

  “Writing-with is a practical technology that reveals itself as both descriptive (it inscribes) and speculative (it connects). It builds relation and community, that is: possibility.” (Bellacasa, 2012, 203)


##   Care:  warning against idealized forms of caring.
   For living with is laborious. Relations of otherness are more than about accommodating ‘difference’, co-existing or tolerating. Thinking with should always be a living with, aware that relations of significant otherness transform those who relate and the worlds they live in. (Bellacasa, 2012, 207)

##    Practices of care in machine learning?
   As yet, very little in evidence!
   What nascent forms of care are there? 
   Not building models that rupture existing relations of otherness through sorting, ranking, etc.
   Not intensifying the distractability of digital media
   Building/inventing/maintaining forms of prediction that increase possibility not standardise or format it 

##    Digital phronesis negotiates the good
   Truth and care may be in tension with each other 
   An action in the name of truth might be inimical to social fabric 
   Creates inhospitable or unstable relationalities

##    Summary
   Digital all-around creates new ethical situations
   Consequentialist and deontological approaches struggle to calculate or normalize
   Virtue-based ethics has some promise
   Digital phronesis: skillfully address actual tensions between goods that we might want to commit to (truth and care)

##    Questions for discussion
   How does something like Buzzfeed change our relation to truth?
   What would phronesis be in relation to digital media that classify, rank, or sort people according to their
