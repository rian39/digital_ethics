This list -- an ontography --  evokes something that we all experience, perhaps somewhat unevenly as the fabric of experience, whether at work, in public places, at home. There as so many possibilities to be sucked in, addicted, fixated, obsessed and stressed by the digital environing. The primary aspect of that experience is:
    - pervasiveness
    - encounters with many unknown others
    - uneven participation and constant divergence
One really needs to be a bodhisattva to live graciously and ethically amidst all this. 
When I think about ethics in this setting, I'm prone to seeing the problem not as one of specific ethic duties, responsibility or norms, but more around how we have a world, and how we live in the world. While there are definitely specific ethical challenges associated with digital media, platforms and practices (and I will discuss some of these), all of digital ethics pivots around the fundamental question of how to live better in such a world. 

## Why normative moral or deontological ethics won't do

The digital environing posed problems for any ethics based on moral norms. The norms are simply not shared in the digital environment. Youtube videos made by ISIS can be found immediately, and the right and wrong of the actions shown there, the right and wrong of watching such videos will not be matters of universal agreement. I'm assuming that we cannot match the basic premise of deontological ethics in the digital everything.   

## Why consequentialist ethics struggle

A consequentialist approach to ethics does not fare much better in this world. If the right thing to do depends on the outcome or consequences -- helping others, my own enjoyment or well-being, preventing harm to others -- it can be pretty hard to know the consequences when a message can go viral,  a mouse-click can subtly re-weight the parameters of a model that  calculates credit risks, and a hyperlink can be weaponised as part of a global surveillance system like XKEYSCORE.   

## The basic character of virtue ethics


## phronesis as a skill

- digital natives or digital naives -- Boyd on this -- no necessary recourse to skill
- technical skills such as hacking seen as politically progressive? e.g. open source; maybe ... I've certainly gone down that route myself
- orientation to two difference senses of care is important, but the technical skills for one kind of care (careful) are way more developed than the other

## what are the ethical conflicts associated with the digital?

## the tensions between knowing and care

## the two cases -- machine learning and social media; journalismi (Buzzfeed) and data science
