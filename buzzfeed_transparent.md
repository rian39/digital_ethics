and kindly contributed to R-bloggers) <http://www.r-bloggers.com/>

The news today was lead in part by a story broken by the BBC and BuzzFeed
News =E2=80=93 The Tennis Racket
<http://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket> =E2=80=93 about matc=
h fixing
in Grand Slam tennis tournaments
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/35319202>. (The BBC contribution seems
to have been done under the ever listenable File on Four: Tennis: Game, Set
and Fix? <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wd7f0>)

One interesting feature of this story was that *=E2=80=9CBuzzFeed News bega=
n its
investigation after devising an algorithm to analyse gambling on
professional tennis matches over the past seven years=E2=80=9D*, backing up
evidence from leaked documents with *=E2=80=9Can original analysis of the b=
etting
activity on 26,000 matches=E2=80=9D*. Feature detecting algorithms such as =
this
(where the feature is an unusual betting pattern) are likely to play an
increasing role in the discovery of stories from data, step 2 in the model
described in this recent Tow Center for Digital Journalism *Guide to
Automated Journalism*
<http://towcenter.org/research/guide-to-automated-journalism/>:]

t

<http://blog.ouseful.info/2015/06/15/notes-on-robot-churnalism-part-i-robot=
-writers/>

Another interesting aspect of the story behind the story was the way in
which BuzzFeed News opened up the analysis they had applied to the data.
You can find it described on Github =E2=80=93 Methodology and Code: Detecti=
ng
Match-Fixing Patterns In Tennis
<https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-01-tennis-betting-analysis> =E2=80=93=
 along
with the data and a Jupyter notebook that includes the code used to perform
the analysis: Data and Analysis: Detecting Match-Fixing Patterns In Tennis
<https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-01-tennis-betting-analysis/blob/maste=
r/notebooks/tennis-analysis.ipynb>
.

You can even run the notebook to replicate the analysis yourself, either by
downloading it and running it using your own Jupyter notebook server, or by
using the online mybinder <http://mybinder.org/> service: run the tennis
analysis yourself on
<http://app.mybinder.org/3557331845/notebooks/notebooks/tennis-analysis.ipy=
nb>*mybinder.org
<http://app.mybinder.org/3557331845/notebooks/notebooks/tennis-analysis.ipy=
nb>*
.

(I=E2=80=99m not sure if the BuzzFeed or BBC folk tried to do any deeper an=
alysis,
for example poking into point summary data as captured by the Tennis Match
Charting Project
<https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_MatchChartingProject>? See also
this Teniis Visuals <https://github.com/TennisVisuals> project that makes
use of the MCP data. Tennis etting data is also collected here:
tennis-data.co.uk <http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.php>. If you=E2=80=
=99re
into the idea of analysing tennis stats, this book is one way in: Analyzing
Wimbledon: The Power Of Statistics
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Analyzing-Wimbledon-Statistics-Franc-Klaassen/dp/0=
199355967/?tag=3Douseful-21>
.)

So what are these notebooks anyway? They=E2=80=99re magic, that=E2=80=99s w=
hat!:-)

The Jupyter project is an evolution of an earlier IPython (interactive
Python) project that included a browser based notebook style interface for
allowing users to write and execute code, as well as seeing the result of
executing the code, a line at a time, all in the context of a =E2=80=9Cnarr=
ative=E2=80=9D
text document. The Jupyter project funding proposal
<http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/07/07/project-jupyter-computational-narrative=
s-as-the-engine-of-collaborative-data-science/>
describes it thus:

[T]he core problem we are trying to solve is *the collaborative creation of
reproducible computational narratives that can be used across a wide range
of audiences and contexts*.
=E2=80=A6
[C]omputation in science is ultimately in service of a result that needs to
be woven into the bigger narrative of the questions under study: that
result will be part of a paper, will support or contest a theory, will
advance our understanding of a domain. And those insights are communicated
in papers, books and lectures: narratives of various formats.

The problem the Jupyter project tackles is precisely this intersection:
creating tools to support in the best possible ways the computational
workflow of scientific inquiry, and providing the environment to create the
proper narrative around that central act of computation. We refer to this
as Literate Computing, in contrast to Knuth=E2=80=99s concept of Literate
Programming, where the emphasis is on narrating algorithms and programs. In
a Literate Computing environment, the author weaves human language with
live code and the results of the code, and it is the combination of all
that produces a computational narrative.
=E2=80=A6
At the heart of the entire Jupyter architecture lies the idea of
interactive computing: humans executing small pieces of code in various
programming languages, and immediately seeing the results of their
computation. Interactive computing is central to data science because
scientific problems benefit from an exploratory process where the results
of each computation inform the next step and guide the formation of
insights about the problem at hand. In this Interactive Computing focus
area, we will create new tools and abstractions that improve the
reproducibility of interactive computations and widen their usage in
different contexts and audiences.


The Jupyter notebooks include two types of interactive cell =E2=80=93 edita=
ble text
cells into which you can write simple markdown and HTML text that will be
rendered as text; and code cells into which you can write executable code.
Once executed, the results of that execution are displayed as cell output.
Note that the output from a cell may be text, a datatable, a chart, or even
an interactive map.

One of the nice things about the Jupyter notebook project is that the
executable cells are connected via the Jupyter server to a programming
*kernel* that executes the code. An increasing number of kernels are
supported
<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-language=
s>
(e.g. for R, Javascript and Java as well as Python) so once you hook in to
the Jupyter ecosystem you can use the same interface for a wide variety of
computing tasks.

There are multiple ways of running Jupyter notebooks, including the
*mybinder* approach described above, =E2=80=93 I describe several of them i=
n the
post Seven Ways of Running IPython Notebooks
<http://blog.ouseful.info/2014/12/12/seven-ways-of-running-ipython-notebook=
s/>
.

As well as having an important role to play in reproducible data journalism
and reproducible (scientific) research, notebooks are also a powerful, and
expressive, medium for teaching and learning. For example, we=E2=80=99re ju=
st about
to star using Jupyter notebooks, delivered via a virtual machine, for the
new OU course Data management and analysis
<http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/tm351>.

We also used them in the FutureLearn course Learn to Code for Data Analysis
<https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learn-to-code>, showing how code could
be used a line at a time to analyse a variety of opendata sets from sources
such as the World Bank Indicators database and the UN Comtrade (import
/export data) database.

PS for sports data fans, here=E2=80=99s a list of data sources I started to=
 compile
a year or so ago: Sports Data and R =E2=80=93 Scope for a Thematic (Rather =
than

The Jupyter notebooks include two types of interactive cell =E2=80=93 edita=
ble text cells into which you can write simple markdown and HTML text that =
will be rendered as text; and code cells into which you can write executabl=
e code. Once executed, the results of that execution are displayed as cell =
output. Note that the output from a cell may be text, a datatable, a chart,=
 or even an interactive map.</p>
<p dir=3D"ltr">One of the nice things about the Jupyter notebook project is=
 that the executable cells are connected via the Jupyter server to a progra=
mming <i>kernel</i> that executes the code. An <a href=3D"https://github.co=
m/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages">increasing numb=
er of kernels are supported</a> (e.g. for R, Javascript and Java as well as=
 Python) so once you hook in to the Jupyter ecosystem you can use the same =
interface for a wide variety of computing tasks.</p>
<p dir=3D"ltr">There are multiple ways of running Jupyter notebooks, includ=
ing the <i>mybinder</i> approach described above, =E2=80=93 I describe seve=
ral of them in the post <a href=3D"http://blog.ouseful.info/2014/12/12/seve=
n-ways-of-running-ipython-notebooks/">Seven Ways of Running IPython Noteboo=
ks</a>.</p>
<p dir=3D"ltr">As well as having an important role to play in reproducible =
data journalism and reproducible (scientific) research, notebooks are also =
a powerful, and expressive, medium for teaching and learning. For example, =
we=E2=80=99re just about to star using Jupyter notebooks, delivered via a v=
irtual machine, for the new OU course <a href=3D"http://www.open.ac.uk/cour=
ses/modules/tm351">Data management and analysis</a>.</p>
<p dir=3D"ltr">We also used them in the FutureLearn course <a href=3D"https=
://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learn-to-code">Learn to Code for Data Analys=
is</a>, showing how code could be used a line at a time to analyse a variet=
y of opendata sets from sources such as the World Bank Indicators database =
and the UN Comtrade (import /export data) database.</p>
